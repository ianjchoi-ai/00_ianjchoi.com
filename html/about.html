|                               About Me                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Hi, I’m Ian J. Choi.
I’m a senior at Columbia University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.

I built FYBCL (For Your Better College Life) — an app that helps students quickly check dining hall menus, library hours, and campus events, so they can spend less time clicking around and avoid walking all the way to the dining hall or library just to realize it’s closed.

Technically, I’m deeply interested in low-level computing such as operating systems and system programming. I enjoy understanding how things actually work under the hood — memory, processes, I/O, performance — and I’m actively studying and building projects in this space.

Before computers, there was swimming.
I’ve been swimming since I was 4, competed as a member of the South Korean national team, and later swam for a Division I team in college. These days, swimming is more of a passion than a profession, and I spend most of my training time on CrossFit and HYROX — still chasing performance, just in different arenas.

I like building things, pushing limits, and staying curious — whether that’s in code, systems, or sport.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
This is not just about computers, but my life. 
I’ve lived a very diverse life, and I’m still pursuing that same richness.

2001 — Born.
       Don’t have much memory from this time. Fair enough.

2005 — Started swimming.
       Not just swimming — I tried soccer, basketball, running, violin, and piano.
       My mom wanted me to become a “human weapon,” but also be good at the arts.
       Balance was important.

2014 — Entered Seoul Physical Education Middle School as a swimmer.
       A typical day looked like this:
         06:00–07:00  Swim
         08:00–12:00  Study
         14:00–18:00  Swim
         20:00–21:00  Dryland training

       I trained hard, but I studied just as hard.
       This was when my name started to become known in the swimming world.
       The friends I met here are still my closest friends.
       We trained together, ate together, and studied together — six hours of training a day,
       every day, for three straight years.

2017 — In high school, I made the South Korean national reserve swimming team for the first time.
       At the same time, I intentionally stepped outside swimming.
       I attended Seoul High School to focus more on academics.
       I went to Kyoto and Osaka as an exchange student,
       started a club to learn C++,
       and read classic Eastern philosophy books.
       I wanted more than just one identity.

2020 — Came to the University of Iowa to pursue computer science.
       Took my first CS class with Professor James Cremer.
       Still one of the best computer science classes I’ve ever taken.

2021 — Transferred to Columbia University.
       Built MealChoi — the first version of what later became FYBCL,
       focused solely on dining hall information.
       (There’s an article about this.)

2022 — Entered the military.
       I should say that everything I did there is confidential.
       If you really want to know, DM me.

2026 — Built this website.
